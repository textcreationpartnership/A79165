            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEing importuned to peruſe this Book, in order to another Impreſſion, I have read it over with the greater <hi>Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;</hi> and the more I read, the more I muſt needs ſay I am delighted with it; not only for the Excellency of the <hi>Subject,</hi> but alſo for the accurate handling of it. If the Books penn'd by the <hi>Jeſuit Drexelius,</hi> and by <hi>Cardinal Bona,</hi> treating of <hi>Eternity,</hi> put into an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Dreſs, have found much acceptance, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks this Choice Diſcourſe, written in our Mother-Tongue, by an Eminent <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Divine, ſhould be greedily peruſed, and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embraced by all ſound <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> Since ſuch will be more apt to confide, that the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are <hi>Orthodox,</hi> when Communicated by an able Teacher of their own Profeſſion, who <hi>paints for Eternity,</hi> in a more excellent Senſe than <hi>Zeuxis</hi> did, giving Life to each Head from the Infallible Oracles of God, and embelliſhing the Whole not by Engrav'd Pictures, but perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and delightful Enlargements from both Divine and Humane Story; apt Reſemblances, and acute Sentences, ſtill conſonant to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Matter. Here's a <hi>Method</hi> very eaſie and natural, a <hi>Stile</hi> not mean nor ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; here are <hi>Explications</hi> clear and full,
<pb facs="tcp:135134:3"/> 
               <hi>Arguments</hi> ſtrong and concluſive, <hi>Cautions</hi> judicious and neceſſary, <hi>Lamentations</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations</hi> pathetical, <hi>Exhortations</hi> lively and pertinent, <hi>Motives</hi> powerful and ſuaſive, <hi>Directions</hi> proper and advantagious, and all correspondent to the <hi>Subject.</hi> 'Tis true, we here below are but of yeſterday, and know nothing, our days on earth being a ſhadow; yet conſidering <hi>God is from everlaſting to everlaſting,</hi> we are concerned to walk in the way everlasting, having this <hi>everlaſting</hi> Conſolation and good hope through Grace, that <hi>He</hi> will ſave us with <hi>everlaſting</hi> Salvation. His Strength is <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> and ſo is his Mercy; which may excite us to go up the Hill, and take a <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſight of the heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> which is ſo ſurpaſſing, that the moſt refined Souls here, after all their diligent Searches and Reſearches, can get but a <hi>Glimpſe</hi> or Glimmering of it; which <hi>He</hi> who inhabits that pleaſant Seat, is <hi>alone</hi> able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.

It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns therefore every created Immortal Being to take all advantages in this <hi>alterable</hi> State, of minding that <hi>unchangeable Miſery</hi> or <hi>Felicity</hi> which abides us all, that we may not ſlide una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares into an <hi>unalterable State</hi> of <hi>endleſs Torment,</hi> but, by getting an Intereſt in the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus,</hi> when we are diſlodg'd theſe cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſom clayie Cottages, enter into <hi>his Joy,</hi> even that <hi>entire duration of endleſs Delight.</hi> Our <hi>Author</hi> hath put one of the beſt <hi>Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives</hi> into our hands; That we may uſe it for the End to which it is deſign'd, is the heartieſt Prayer of him who recommends it to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Reader.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>From God,</hi> it is true, God enjoys all happineſs in himſelf, and can receive no addition thereunto from the creature; all his happineſs is in himſelf, in the injoymeut of himſelf, in the contemplation of his own perfection; he was as happy, before Heaven or Earth, Angels, or Men were made, as he is now, and would be ſo, were all creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their firſt nothing; as <hi>Seneca</hi> divinely, <hi>if the world were conſumed, all the Angels anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated, and nature ceaſe to be, yet being left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135134:8"/> he enjoyeth all in himſelf:</hi> but though he be <hi>in himſelf God over all, bleſſed for ever,</hi> yet it pleaſed God, for the manifeſting the Glory of his Attributes, to make a world of Creatures, and, among others, <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi> upon whom he imprinted ſome more conſpicuous Characters and Draughts of his own Perfections; and among others, made them parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of his own <hi>Immortality,</hi> that upon them he might manifeſt the Glory either of his Mercy, or his Wrath. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, indured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction? and that he might make known the glory of his mercy on the veſſels of mercy, which he had before prepared unto glory</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22, 23.</note>? To this purpoſe, though he made both righteous, yet he left both to the <hi>freedom</hi> of their own will, that if they did <hi>well,</hi> they might do it out of <hi>choice</hi> and good-will, not of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; if they did <hi>ill,</hi> it ſhould be by their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault: And though God was no ways the <hi>cauſe</hi> of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſin, nor ordained either to puniſhment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reference to their <hi>ſin;</hi> yet he foreſaw they would abuſe their <hi>free-will,</hi> by ſinning againſt him, and by <hi>ſin</hi> make themſelves obnoxious to his <hi>wrath;</hi> and accordingly ordained, that thoſe <hi>Angels</hi> that ſtood, and thoſe of <hi>Mankind</hi> that after their Fall would accept of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> ſhould live <hi>eternally</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Glory and Happineſs. On the <hi>other</hi> ſide, that thoſe of the <hi>Angels</hi> who left <hi>their firſt habitation,</hi> and thoſe of the Sons of <hi>men</hi> who rejected the help of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> ſhould for <hi>ever</hi> feel the weight of his diſpleaſure. So that to deny the <hi>eternal</hi> condition of Man after this Life, is quite repugnant to that great Deſign of God, whereby he appointed both <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men to be, for ever,</hi> either the <hi>perpetual</hi> Objects of his <hi>Free-grace,</hi> or the <hi>everlaſting</hi> Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his juſtly deſerved <hi>Wrath.</hi>

               <p>HAving endeavoured to <hi>demonſtrate the</hi> point from <hi>Arguments,</hi> I proceed to <hi>prove it from Scripture;</hi> though it be unuſual in the method of Preaching, to bring <hi>Arguments</hi> before Scripture-proofs; yet it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Argumentation, to reſerve the ſtrongeſt Proof till laſt. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> reporteth, that at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Nice,</hi> a <hi>Godly</hi> man of no great learning, was the means of Converting a learned <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> whom the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135134:17"/> 
                  <hi>Biſhops</hi> with all their <hi>Arguments</hi> could not perſwade; the perſon brake forth into this ſpeech: <hi>Againſt words I oppoſed words, and what was ſpoken, I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw by the art of ſpeaking; but when inſtead of words, power came out of the mouth of the ſpeaker, words could no longer withſtand truth, nor man oppoſe the power of God:</hi> Poſſibly what is ſpoken by way of <hi>Argument,</hi> may not be ſo convincing to ſome, who will ſeek to elude the ſtrength of one Argument by another, whereas <hi>proofs from plain places of Scripture</hi> ſilence all cavils and exceptions; that therefore I have reſerved for the laſt proof. There is a <hi>twofold Eternity,</hi> one of <hi>Happineſs,</hi> the other of <hi>Miſery;</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> is abundant in the <hi>proof of both:</hi> I begin with the <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Heaven. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> diſtinguiſh of a <hi>two-fold happineſs;</hi> one they call the <hi>eſſential happineſs,</hi> which they make to conſiſt in the enjoyment of God; the other <hi>accidental,</hi> conſiſting in the enjoyment of thoſe glorious things, which God, together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, giveth unto his people. <hi>Others</hi> ſay to the ſame purpoſe, that there is an <hi>uncreated</hi> reward, which is God himſelf, <hi>I am thy exceeding great reward</hi>

               <p>Oh fools and ſlow of heart, to believe what the Scripture hath ſpoken, and what Miniſters preach<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Iſidor.</note>! It was the complaint of one, <hi>That eternal happineſs in Heaven is every way unſpeakably great, and is freely offered to us;</hi> and yet, who ſpends ſo much as one hour in the meditation and purſuit of it? Who is it that talketh of it to his Wife, and Children, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily? We can riot in the praiſes of our Native ſoil, but are aſhamed to ſpeak of our Heavenly Country, our everlaſting Home; in the things of this life, our Underſtandings are quick enough to conceive them; our hearts to embrace them; our tongues to ſpeak of them: but in the things of Eternity, how deep is our ſilence? how ſlow our ſpeech?

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135134:52"/> men indeed ſometimes raiſe the expectations of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when after a noiſe of the mountains bringing forth, a ridiculous mouſe creepeth out: but God doth not thus uſe to deceive the expectations of his people: ſuch <hi>great preparations</hi> as are here deſcribed, are always attended with ſome <hi>remarkable</hi> thing ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſuch preparations; now what this <hi>great thing</hi> was, follows: <hi>He ſware by him that liveth for ever;</hi> that <hi>time ſhall be no longer;</hi> whether it be meant of <hi>time</hi> in general, as ſome contend, or of the <hi>time</hi> of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts rage, and the Churches ſuffering, as others think more probable, <hi>either</hi> ſerves to inform us of what great worth <hi>time</hi> is, and what a great puniſhment it is to be deprived of it.</p>
               <p>Much more might be ſpoken of the preciouſneſs of <hi>time,</hi> as that it is the fruit of Chriſts purchaſe; that doom paſſed upon <hi>Adam, in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> had been immediately upon his <hi>ſin</hi> put in execution, had not God given Chriſt to interpoſe between <hi>his wrath</hi> and <hi>mans ſin:</hi> that there was any time given him; it was not only <hi>through Gods indulgence, but through the purchaſe of Chriſts blood.</hi>

Many men are more troubled, I will not ſay for a <hi>Wife</hi> or a <hi>Child,</hi> but for the <hi>loſs</hi> of a <hi>Horſe,</hi> or a <hi>Cow,</hi> than to hear they are in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hazard of loſing <hi>eternal happineſs;</hi> but when <hi>after</hi> death they ſhall find themſelves for <hi>ever</hi> deprived of it, and ſhall have their underſtandings cleared, and enlarged to know the worth of what they have <hi>loſt,</hi> then they will conclude that their is no loſs like <hi>this loſs;</hi> and would think themſelves <hi>happy,</hi> if upon any conditions they might be but ſome <hi>little</hi> time within the poſſibilites of <hi>happineſs:</hi> They would be willing to give any thing, <hi>thouſands of Rams, ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl,</hi> or whatſoever men count <hi>precious:</hi> they would be willing to do any thing, if <hi>prayers, tears, humiliations, watchings, faſtings</hi> would prevail to regain <hi>loſt</hi> time, how gladly would all this, and much more be <hi>undertaken?</hi> If it were to be regained by hewing their way through <hi>Rocks</hi> of ſtone, by ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming through <hi>Seas</hi> of blood, by encountring the greateſt difficulties and dangers, how willingly would they undertake any thing that is <hi>poſſible</hi> to be done? they would be willing to <hi>ſuffer</hi> any thing, if enduring the pain of a <hi>thouſand deaths,</hi> if lying a <hi>thouſand years</hi> in Hell, would ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for their <hi>former</hi> neglects, and prevail for ſome <hi>longer</hi> time to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged them, how tolerable would this ſeem? How gladly would they accept of the <hi>Conditions?</hi> But <hi>alas</hi> it will then be <hi>to late,</hi> the door of hope and mercy will be then for <hi>ever ſhut</hi> up againſt them; they will have nothing then to do, but to lament their <hi>doleful loſs,</hi> and that they will do with <hi>howlings</hi> and <hi>lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,</hi> able to rend <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Marbles</hi> in pieces.</p>
